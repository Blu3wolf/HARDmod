# HARDmod
A Spiritual Successor to NARMod - a reimagined Factorio Experience

This is an Alpha version of HARDmod based strongly off NARMod files. Future versions may be significantly different, and savegame compatibility is not guaranteed. 

HARDmod is a Factorio mod which creates a complete experience for advanced players. For those players who have fully experienced vanilla Factorio and are craving increased challenge and complexity in building and crafting their own industrial revolution, HARDmod delivers that challenge. HARDmod is complex. HARDmod is not for everyone. HARDmod is HARD.

HARDmod primarily makes changes to the construction and crafting aspects of the game. Hand crafting is almost entirely disabled! This drives a push towards automation almost immediately, although the starting game is far slower than vanilla. Chemical production is a major factor in the mid game, and metallurgy is a key focus for the mod, with a variety of real metals and ores to smelt. Prospecting will be important, given the rarity of ores - trains WILL be essential to collect useful ores from distant mines. In the late game, the large scale macro focus Factorio lends itself to will be familiar, with a few differences players of Bob's mods will be used to. Modules are used to improve factories on the macro scale, with the player aiming to complete the rocket to space, completing the game! As with all playthroughs though, it isnt about the destination... its about how you get there!

HARDmod has limited compatibility with other mods, aside from those it is dependent on. In general, large scale overhaul mods are unsupported and will not work well. Small scale mods which only change a small part of the game, may work, but are unsupported unless specifically stated otherwise.

HARDmod contains content originally released as part of F-mod, by ficolas. 

HARDmod also requires the following mods installed to work correctly:
* Treefarm
* Bob's Library
* Bob's Minerals, Chemicals and Elements
* Bob's Electronics

Bob's Library must be enabled in the game UI for HARDmod to function correctly. Bob's Electronics and MCI mods must be disabled in the game UI for HARDmod to function correctly, but the mod folders must still be present! This is to avoid distributing unlicensed content of those mods, specifically certain graphics are not included with HARDmod that are originally part of Bob's mods.
