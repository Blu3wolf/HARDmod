# HARDmod
A Spiritual Successor to NARMod - a reimagined Factorio Experience

HARDmod is a Factorio mod compilation which creates a complete experience for advanced players. For those players who have fully experienced vanilla Factorio and are craving increased challenge and complexity in building and crafting their own industrial revolution, HARDmod delivers that challenge. HARDmod is complex. HARDmod is not for everyone. HARDmod is HARD.

HARDmod primarily makes changes to the construction and crafting aspects of the game. HARDmod has limited compatibility with other mods, aside from those it is dependent on. 

HARDmod contains content originally released as part of F-mod, by ficolas. 

HARDmod also requires the following mods installed to work correctly:
* Treefarm by drs9999
* Dytech by Dysoch
* Bob's Ores
* Bob's Minerals, Chemicals and Elements
* Bob's Electronics
