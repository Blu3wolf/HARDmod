[item-description]
iron-ore = Iron Ore can be smelted into Iron Plates. The smelting goes much faster if the ore is crushed first.
copper-ore = Like most ores, Porphyry Copper is primarily iron, but it contains a fair amount of Copper which can be obtained by crushing and separating it.
lead-concentrate = Also called Galena, small amounts of lead are usually found in larger copper deposits. Galena is processed by being separated from the copper ore, smelted in a Blast Furnace, and then forged.
zinc-concentrate = Also called Sphalerite, small amounts of zinc are usually found in larger copper deposits. Spelter is processed by being separated from the copper ore, leached with Sulfuric Acid, electrolysed, then forged.
tin-ore = Also called Cassiterite, Tin Ore is processed by being smelted in an Electric Furnace along with Coke into Tin Plates.
gold-ore = Gold is one of the only metals that can be found as a native metal in the ground, but it is extremely rare, and is more commonly found in Iron Ore. Native Gold is processed by being smelted and forged into plates.
gold-concentrate = Gold is more commonly found mixed in with other ores, such as iron. It is processed by being separated from the iron ore, mixed into a cyanide solution, electrolysed with chlorine, and forged into plates.
heavy-machine-gun = Can barely move while firing if hand held, but can be mounted on a turret or vehicle.

[technology-description]
material-processing = Grind up stone and ores, and perform froth flotation to prepare ores for further processing.
blast-furnaces = Methods for smelting various metals in better and more efficient ways.
evaporators = Disperse unneeded liquids and gasses back into the atmosphere.
tin-and-lead-processing = Enables the smelting of tin and lead ores, and the production of solder.
extraction-technology = Allows for the extraction of various non-ore materials from out of the ground. Extractors may be placed anywhere, and do not require an ore field. Most recipes require water to function.
cokery-manufacturing = Allows for raw wood and coal to be reduced to various fuels and carbon products.
air-compressor = Air compressors are used in the production of compressed air.
stone-walls = Concrete is made from cement, and this technology enables both products.
automation=Key technology for large scale production.
logistic-robotics=Logistic robots are a flexible alternative to conveyor belts.
logistics=Faster and more flexible ways of transportation.
solar-energy=Source of infinite energy, but useless at night.
laser-turrets=Laser turrets are second tier defensive structures. They need electricity, but no ammunition.
turrets=Allows the building of basic defending structures.
rocket-defense=Rocket defense is needed to defend the landing of our ships.
steel-processing=Turn steel plates into various processed items.
automated-rail-transportation=Enables building of train stations, these can be used to setup automated train routes.
rail-signals=Enables organizing multiple trains on single rail network.
electric-energy-accumulators=Accumulators are used to store electric energy.
inserter-stack-size-bonus=When inserters are moving from one container to another (or loading/unloading trains) they can move more items at the same time.
character-logistic-slots=Allows player to order items from storage and provider chests. These items will be delivered by the logistic robots.
modules=Opens door to the upgrade modules researches.
speed-module=Speed modules push the machine speed to the limit but they increase the energy consumption.
productivity-module=Productivity modules push the machine productivity to the limit (Enables making more products from the same amount of ingredients) but they increase the energy consumption.
effectivity-module=Efficiency modules decrease the energy consumption of machines.
combat-robotics=Combat robots help to fight the enemy with their guns. They are spawned from the capsules and have a limited lifetime. Some follow the player.
toolbelt=Adds second quickbar. This is especially useful for storing capsules.
follower-robot-count=Adds to the maximum count of active following robots at the same time.

alloy-processing=Learn how to combine more than one ingredient to make an alloy.
chemical-processing=Research into to use and production of chemicals.
electrolysis=Electrolysis is used to separate a compound into its component parts, such as water into hydrogen and oxygen.

advanced-metals-processing = Research how to refine more advanced metals.

aluminium-processing=Research how to purify aluminium, a fairly strong light weight metal.
gold-processing=Research how to refine gold.
nickel-processing=Research how to refine nickel.
lead-processing=Research how to refine lead.
silicon-processing=Research how to purify silicon for use in electronics and other things.
titanium-processing=Titanium is a very strong light weight metal, but hard to separate from its ore.
tungsten-processing=Tungsten has a very high melting point, let's research how to refine it another way.
tungsten-alloy-processing=Research how to make Tungsten based alloys, this might make it even more useful.
